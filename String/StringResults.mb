Experiment with different values of the index character. Add a print statement to the index of the character in the console.  
Result: When I entered a different number is concluded that the character index  
was at -1.

Change the index character to one that doesn't exist in the phrase.  
Result: The same thing happens as if I were to enter a random number,   
-1 is concluded as the character index.
