Modify the program to instantiate the Random object using a seed value as shown below
Result: When I ran the program 3 times after modifying it  
the same numbers were generated. This is because we instantiated a pattern for the program  
to choose the same numbers everytime. 
Test 1, 2, 3- 
A random integer: 1553932502
From 0 to 9: 0
From 1 to 10: 2
From 20 to 34: 23
From -10 to 9: 5
A random float (between 0 and 1): 0.03767297158354166
From 1 to 6: 1
